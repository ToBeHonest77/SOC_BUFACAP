Read packages and input data -> data comes from 02_climate_data.R and 01_auto_database_FB.R
This is the first try to automatize the process of modeling...
```{r Packages}
## load packages
library(SoilR)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read dataframes from both scripts before continue (first parts)
# > 02_climate_data_FB.R holds all important data on climate
# > 01_auto_database_FB.R holds all important data on soils
```

#!# values from ERA5 tiff are all negative, calculation error?

-- Spin-up section -------------------------------------------------------------

The information of vegetation periods has to be taken directly from the literature or NDVI values, if not available in LTFEs

Split climate data up for historical spin-up and prediction model 
(The split-up assignment 1970-1990 and 1991-2024 is random and follows no peer-reviewed basis)

According to Pe√±a Cabriales et al. (2006) on pg. 59 it says: "one rainy season per year, starting in May-June and ending in October." Filter is set accordingly.
```{r Climate Monthly Means}
# Monthly means from climate_data_FB.R
mm1 <- read.csv2("output/farako_ba/climate/mm_1970_1990.csv", header = TRUE) %>% select(-1)
mm2 <- read.csv2("output/farako_ba/climate/mm_1991_2024.csv", header = TRUE) %>% select(-1)

# Filter Month and Experiment for Section1 Rain
mm1_sec1 <- mm1 %>%
  filter(Month >= 5 & Month <= 10) %>% 
  filter(Experiment == "Farako-Ba") # Choose the experiment

# Filter Month and Experiment for Section2 Dry
mm2_sec2 <- mm2 %>%
  filter(Month %in% c(11:12, 1:4)) %>% # to filter months through year
  filter(Experiment == "Farako-Ba") # Choose the experiment
```

```{r Sec.1 Climate}
# Climate data for Farako-ba, Burkina Faso for 1970-1990 (ERA5)

```

>> CHECK IF VEGETATION PERIOD IS RIGHT

Section1: Vegetation (Rainy Season) = TRUE (bare = FALSE)
Section2: Vegetation (Dry Season) = FALSE (bare = TRUE)

The idea is, to divide the model calibration into two steps. First step, only for the months with vegetation (Section1) and second step, only for months without vegetation (Section2). 
The respective months should be derived from NDVI or literature values, to make sure during the months there is actually no vegetation covering soils. This also affects Cinputs during the same time (probably around 0). After Section1 & 2 there should be a Section3 combining both models to generate output.

Average value for BAU SOC stock = 17.2 t/ha from 1980-2015
Average value for SALM SOC stock = 22.7 t/ha 1980-2015
Therefore average SOC stock = 19.95

-- Prediction section ----------------------------------------------------------
In this section different long-term experiments can be used to predict SOC content in the future.
The data comes from EJPSoil_template database and must be summarized to fit the code.
All climate data comes from ERA5 and must be transformed as mentioned in spin-up run above.
Cinputs must be seperated into business-as-usual (BAU) and project scenario or sustainable agricultural land management (SALM).
With the different inputs, different predictions into future (usually 20 y) will be done.
Clay content and initial SOC must be derived from the respective long-term experiment or strata.
Different long-term experiments are summarized under few strata e.g. IPCC climate zones (CZ) or agro-ecological zones (AEZ).
